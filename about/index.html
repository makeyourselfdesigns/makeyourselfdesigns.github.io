<p>Hello! I am the Owner and sole employee of MYD. I design, create, detail, and sew all makeup bags myself. Every day I create my future. I love being a #girlboss and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been this passionate about anything in my life!
<br></p>

<h3 id="story">Story</h3>

<p><br>
MYD was founded when I (Jess) woke up and realized my 9-5 lackluster call job wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling. I was longing for creativity, desperate to make something&hellip;.anything! I had tried doing beauty reviews on Instagram, but even that wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>I knew I needed to do something big, so I bought a sewing machine and began to teach myself the craft. Once I made my first makeup bag I was beaming from head to toe (even though it had a hole in the side), I thought it was the most imperfect/perfect bag I&rsquo;ve laid eyes on. The thrill of this kept me at my sewing machine for weeks practicing and perfecting the art of sewing these bags (i&rsquo;m still learning!).</p>

<p>I quit my 9-5 and settled for part-time work because this passion that I have for owning my own business is the best feeling of accomplishment I&rsquo;ve ever felt! MYD is new, but it is growing, and I am constantly learning and applying knowledge to my brand every day. I hope you enjoy looking at my bags and maybe even fall in love with one yourself! :)</p>
